# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course - Intelligent Contract Bridge System

## Summary

In modern online contract bridge (card game) systems a more or less intelligent system (robot) is available which plays the oppenents and/or partners roles. These robots are based on algorithms which are kept secret. Different systems exist. 
This project aims at an intelligent playing machine based on actual (avaolable) input of world class players. 

## Background

The idea is to simulate an intelligent (world class) bridge player in the two roles of declarer and defender based on deep learning methods. 
Existing systems are mainly based on the well described strategies which follow the flow of decisions of an experienced players.
The solution searched for in this project will be based on (available) analyses of thousands of training set using deep learnin AI methods.

The solution has at this stage a mainly academic aspect. 

## How is it used?

In the early stage of the project the system will be a prooh of concept. Later the system could assist beginners and intermediate bridge player in understanding the best solution of contract bridge.

Later steps can be an integration in new developed or existing online bridge systems e.g. BBO, Fundbridge, Sharkbridge. Some of the systems declare to be based of (not specified) AI methods. 

The final stage would be a competition with the best playing systems (for contract bridge): conventionally or AI baesd.

## Data sources and AI methods
In principle, data is available in the databases of several bridge societies and online systems. At this stage it is not clear if the access to these trainingsdata is granted. But for academic use it should be possible.

## Challenges

No ethicals considerations are expected to be critical. 
Methods of deep learning based on Neural Networks might be the starting point. More details are (at this stage) not considered. 

## What next?

As more or less academic approach the project mainly focuses on a simple model suitable for proof of concept. 
Next level would be an aplication in the training of beginners and intermediates.
In a final stage the system could compete with the best (other) systems.
