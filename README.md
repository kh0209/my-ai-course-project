# Intelligent Bridge Playing System - Building AI course project

An Intelligent Contract Bridge Playing System (robot) based on AI.

## Summary

This (course-) project aims at the develpment of an intelligent "playing machine" based on AI methodes for modern online contract bridge (card game) applications.

## Background

The idea is to simulate an intelligent (world class) bridge player in the two roles of (first step) declarer and (second, more complicated step) defender based on deep learning methods. 
Due to the complexity of the Bridge game with about 5.36 * 10 power 28 different card combinations it is not feasible to check all solutions with brute force approaches. 
Existing systems (1), (2), (3) are mainly based on well described strategies which in principle follow the flow of decisions made of experienced players. At least on system (2) states that its "playing engine" uses (not specified) AI-methods. The solution searched for in this project will be based on (available) analyses of thousands of training sets using deep learning AI methods (or comparable AI-methods).

The solution has at this stage a mainly academic aspect. 

## How is it used?

In the early stage of the project the system will be a proof of concept. Later the system could assist beginners and intermediate bridge players in understanding the best solution of contract bridge.

Later steps can be an integration in new developed or existing online bridge systems or in a new system. 

The final stage would be a competition with the best playing systems (for contract bridge): conventionally or AI baesd.

## Data sources and AI methods
In principle, data is available in the databases of several bridge societies (4) (5) and online systems. At this stage it is not clear if the access to these trainingsdata is granted. But for academic use it should be possible.

## Challenges

No ethicals considerations are expected to be critical. 
Methods of deep learning based on Neural Networks might be the starting point. More details are (at this stage) not considered. 

## What next?

As more or less academic approach the project mainly focuses on a simple model suitable for proof of concept. 
Next level would be an aplication in the training of beginners and intermediates.
In a final stage the system could compete with the best (other) systems.
